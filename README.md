# jobdii

A Java library for interacting with the OBDII protocol. Specifically, the library communicates with devices 
supporting the ELM chipset and its RS232-based communications protocol.

This lets you write Java code to get access to all the goodies your car knows.

See my [car hacking](http://www.willmeyer.com/things/car-hacking/electronics) stuff for more information
on how I actually use this.  

## Setup

- com.willmeyer.jrs232, with its attendant install requirements, to access the serial port
- connect an ELM device via virtual serial port, via USB
